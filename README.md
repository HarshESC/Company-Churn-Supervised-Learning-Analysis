Summary:

A telecomm company would like to predict their churn rate in order to make decisions for the future growth of their company.  

Telecom companies can suffer from voluntary churn. They spend thousands of dollars just to acquire a new customer.  But, when that customer leaves, the company not only loses the future revenue from that customer, but also the resources spent to acquire that customer.  As a result, it causes a loss in profits.

The churn rate helps determine whether customers tend to stay with the company.  

For example if a company has 25% churn rate then the average customer lifetime is 4 years; similarly a company with a churn rate of 50%, has an average customer lifetime of 2 years. It is estimated that 75 percent of the 17 to 20 million subscribers signing up with a new wireless carrier every year are coming from another wireless provider, which means they are churners. 

In this analysis, we will be exploring the rate at which customers churn using a series of Machine Learning Algorithms.  I will be using two techniques, Select K Best and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in order to pick the best features that help predict the churn rate.
